# PHASE-01 Slice #5 — Global Search

**Status:** Phases 1–3 complete; Phase 4 Architecture awaiting approval  
**Date:** 2026-07-19  
**Remote:** https://github.com/tekrogen/ebia-money-manager  
**Issue:** [#38](https://github.com/tekrogen/ebia-money-manager/issues/38)  
**Feature workflow:** 7-phase (`/feature/workflow`)  
**Slice:** Phase 01 vertical slice #5  
**Canonical architecture:** `admin/internal/features/architecture/README.md` §36  

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

### Goals

- [x] Confirm Slice #5 is next feature work after Slice #4 close-out + cleanup (#30–#34)
- [x] Capture problem, architecture target, and current codebase reality
- [x] List searchable entities that exist today vs architecture MVP scope
- [x] Record assumptions, out-of-scope, and open questions for Phase 3
- [x] File tracking issue (#38) and start workflow doc

**Verdict:** Next feature work is **Phase 01 vertical slice #5 — Global Search**.

### What's done

| Slice | Status |
|-------|--------|
| #1 Auth + onboarding + cards + overview | Done |
| #2 Paydown priority + promo payoff | Done |
| #3 Payment runway + intent flow | Done (Phases 6–7 closed) |
| #4 Statements | Done (Phases 1–7); cleanup PR #37 for #30–#34 |

### What's next (slice #5)

| Surface | Status | Goal |
|---------|--------|------|
| `src/features/search/` | Missing | Search domain: types, schemas, service, queries, components |
| `components/layout/global-search.tsx` | Missing | Thin shell importing `@/features/search` |
| Dashboard header mount | Missing | Search in `DashboardShell` top bar (architecture §2 / §36) |
| Debounced client → server search | Missing | Grouped results with deep links, household/user scoped |

### Problem / user

Household members need a **fast way to find cards (and later transactions/merchants)** from anywhere in the dashboard — by name, last four, institution — without navigating through lists first.

### Key requirements (from architecture §36)

- Real MVP capability, not a shell placeholder
- Scope (architecture text):
  - **Transactions** — merchant name, memo, amount
  - **Cards** — name, last four, institution
  - **Merchants** — distinct / normalized merchant names
- `features/search/` owns UI + server search service
- Mount from dashboard shell; not a dedicated `/search` route (service reusable if route added later)
- Always scope by `userId` (project practice: also household for card ownership)
- Deep links; small result payloads; click-through loads full entities
- Debounced client shell → search action/route → `searchService.search({ userId, query })`

### Architecture file structure (target)

```text
features/search/
├── components/
│   ├── global-search.tsx
│   ├── search-results.tsx
│   └── search-result-group.tsx
├── server/
│   ├── queries.ts
│   └── service.ts
├── schemas/
│   └── search-query-schema.ts
└── types/
    └── search-result.ts
```

```text
GlobalSearch (Client shell)
  → debounced query to search action/route
    → searchService.search({ userId, query })
      → cards + transactions + merchants queries
        → grouped results with deep links
```

### Codebase reality (verified 2026-07-19)

| Entity | In Prisma? | Searchable fields today | Deep link today |
|--------|------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **CreditCard** | Yes | `name`, `lastFour`, `issuerKey` / `institutionId` | `/cards/[cardId]` (statements/details) |
| **Statement** | Yes | period dates, balances (not in §36 scope) | `/cards/[cardId]/statements` |
| **Payment / PaymentIntent** | Yes | amounts, status (not in §36 scope) | `/payments/...` |
| **Transaction** | **No** | — | `/transactions/[id]` does not exist |
| **Merchant** | **No** | — | merchant-filtered txn URL does not exist |

Dashboard shell (`src/components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx`) has brand + nav + sign-out only — **no search control**. No `features/search/` and no `global-search.tsx` stub.

### Gap vs architecture

Architecture §36 and §38 list transactions + merchants as MVP search targets, but **Phase 01 has not shipped a Transaction (or Merchant) model or routes**. Building full §36 literally would require either:

1. **Defer** txn/merchant result groups until those domains exist (search cards now; keep empty/stub groups or omit), or  
2. **Expand this slice** to introduce Transaction (+ optional Merchant) schema + seed + minimal list/detail — much larger than “global search,” or  
3. **Search adjacent existing records** (statements / payments) as interim substitutes — diverges from §36 naming.

**Discovery recommendation:** Treat Slice #5 as **cards-first global search** with architecture-shaped feature folder and result-group UI that can grow; explicitly defer transaction/merchant queries to a later slice (or a follow-up issue). Confirm in Phase 3.

### Assumptions

1. Cleanup #30–#34 (PR #37) can merge in parallel; search does not depend on it.
2. Search scopes to the **session user’s household** for cards (same pattern as cards/statements), even though §36 says `userId` only.
3. No dedicated `/search` page in this slice.
4. Minimum query length + debounce (e.g. 2+ chars, ~200–300ms) TBD in Defaults.
5. Institution display can use `issuerKey` until a real Institution entity exists.

### Out of scope (this slice)

- Transaction list / drawer / intercepting routes
- Merchant normalization / merchant entity
- Full-text / SQLite FTS indexes (start with `contains` / prefix filters)
- Notifications menu, sidebar refactor beyond mounting search
- Slice #6 reminder jobs

### Open questions (Phase 3)

Resolved 2026-07-19 — see Phase 3.

### Success criteria (slice done when)

- [ ] Global search mounted in dashboard header + ⌘K / Ctrl+K
- [ ] Household-scoped **cards**, **statements**, and **payments** results with deep links
- [ ] Debounced client shell + Zod-validated server search
- [ ] Unit/integration + E2E coverage green
- [ ] Phases 6–7 review/summary complete

---

## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

### Goals

- [x] Map dashboard shell mount points and auth/session helpers reusable by search
- [x] Trace how cards queries enforce household ownership (pattern to copy)
- [x] Inventory money/date formatting and public `index.ts` patterns for a new feature
- [x] Record exploration findings (gaps, reuse, risks) in this section

### Completion evidence

Exploration recorded 2026-07-19 (codebase walk + explore agent). Findings below.

### Findings

| Area | Finding |
|------|---------|
| **Shell** | `DashboardShell` is an RSC; mount Client `GlobalSearch` island in header (between nav and user). No search stub today. |
| **Auth** | `requireCurrentUser()` → `{ id, householdId, … }`. Actions must resolve scope server-side; never trust client `householdId`. |
| **Cards** | `getCardsForHousehold(householdId)` / `getCardById(cardId, householdId)` via `@/features/cards`. Prefer search-owned Prisma `contains` queries over returning full card DTOs. |
| **Statements** | Only `getStatementsForCard` today — **no household-wide search API**. Need new query joining `card: { householdId }`. |
| **Payments** | Runway is household-scoped with good labels; `PaymentIntent` is user-scoped; durable `Payment` has **no list API** / little seed use. |
| **Client patterns** | `useActionState` + forms everywhere; **no debounce, no ⌘K** precedent — new pattern required. |
| **Money** | `@/lib/formatting/money` `formatMoney(bigint, currency)` — format at service fence so Client never sees BigInt. |
| **Risks** | Weak statement ownership on list-by-card alone; payment deep links are page-level (`/payments/runway`); mobile header crowding. |

### Reuse map

| Need | Reuse |
|------|--------|
| Session | `requireCurrentUser()` |
| Format amounts | `formatMoney` from `@/lib/formatting/money` |
| Mount | `DashboardShell` + thin `components/layout/global-search.tsx` |
| Feature shape | Mirror statements/payments: types → schemas → server → components → `index.ts` |

## Phase 3: Clarifying Questions / Defaults

### Goals

- [x] Resolve open questions from Discovery
- [x] Lock defaults (debounce, min length, result caps, groups in/out)
- [x] Document decisions in this section before Architecture

### Completion evidence

User confirmed 2026-07-19: (1) defer Transaction/Merchant schema, (2) include statements + payments groups, (3) header + ⌘K.

### Locked decisions

| # | Decision | Locked default |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Transaction / Merchant | **Defer** — no new schema this slice |
| 2 | Result groups | **Cards + Statements + Payments** |
| 3 | Keyboard | **Header input + ⌘K / Ctrl+K** palette |
| 4 | Min query length | **2** characters (after trim) |
| 5 | Debounce | **250ms** |
| 6 | Cap | **5** results per group |
| 7 | Route | **No** dedicated `/search` page |
| 8 | Payments meaning | **RunwayItem** (household) + **submitted/processing PaymentIntent** (user); exclude draft/expired; durable `Payment` rows out of MVP |
| 9 | Scope | `householdId` for cards / statements / runway; `userId` for intents |
| 10 | Institution field | Match `issuerKey` / `network` until Institution entity exists |
| 11 | Money in results | Pre-format strings in service via `formatMoney` |
| 12 | Empty / short query | `< 2` chars → no fetch / clear results; `≥ 2` + zero hits → “No results for '…'” |

---

## Phase 4: Architecture Design

### Goals

- [x] Propose ≥2 approaches with trade-offs
- [x] Select one approach and document boundaries (feature public API, actions vs RSC)
- [ ] Obtain explicit user approval before Phase 5
- [x] No implementation in this phase

### Completion evidence

Architecture options designed 2026-07-19. **Awaiting approval** of recommended Option A before implementation.

### Option comparison

| Dimension | A — Search-owned queries | B — Feature adapters | C — Inline in layout |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Coupling | None (own Prisma reads) | Imports cards/statements/payments search helpers | Violates §36 feature folder |
| Extensibility | Add group = add query fn | Each feature must publish adapter | Refactor later when Transactions land |
| Testability | Clear service/integration surface | Split across features | Weak |
| Fit | Matches “search owns queries” constraint | Allowed via public API but coordination-heavy | Rejected |

### Recommendation

**Option A — Search-owned queries** in `src/features/search/`.

Why: matches architecture §36 + repo constraint that search owns household-filtered Prisma reads; keeps adapters out of other features; easy to add `transaction` / `merchant` kinds later.

### Locked blueprint (Option A) — pending approval

#### Feature tree

```text
src/features/search/
├── types.ts
├── schemas.ts                 # searchQuerySchema min 2 / max 200
├── server/
│   ├── queries.ts             # searchCards / searchStatements / searchPayments
│   ├── service.ts             # Promise.all + formatMoney → SearchGroupsDTO
│   └── actions.ts             # searchAction(query) — requireCurrentUser
├── components/
│   ├── search-palette.tsx
│   ├── search-result-group.tsx
│   └── search-result-item.tsx
└── index.ts

src/components/layout/
├── global-search.tsx          # Client island: debounce, ⌘K, mounts palette
└── dashboard-shell.tsx        # inject <GlobalSearch />
```

#### Data flow

```text
Header input or ⌘K/Ctrl+K
  → GlobalSearch (Client): debounce 250ms, useTransition
    → searchAction(query)
      → requireCurrentUser() + Zod
        → searchService.search({ userId, householdId, query })
          → Promise.all([cards, statements, payments])
            → SearchGroupsDTO (strings only; no BigInt on client)
              → SearchPalette (listbox, arrows, Enter, Escape)
```

#### Result DTO

```ts
type SearchResultKind = "card" | "statement" | "payment";

type SearchResultItem = {
  id: string;
  kind: SearchResultKind;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  meta: string | null;
  href: string;
};

type SearchGroupsDTO = {
  query: string;
  groups: {
    cards: SearchResultItem[];
    statements: SearchResultItem[];
    payments: SearchResultItem[];
  };
  totalCount: number;
};
```

#### Deep links

| Kind | href |
|------|------|
| Card | `/cards/[id]` |
| Statement | `/cards/[cardId]/statements` |
| Payment (runway / submitted intent) | `/payments/runway` |

#### Ownership

| Group | Scope |
|-------|--------|
| Cards | `householdId`, not archived |
| Statements | `card.householdId` |
| RunwayItem | `householdId` |
| PaymentIntent | `userId` + status in `submitted` \| `processing` |

#### Keyboard / a11y (MVP)

- ⌘K / Ctrl+K opens; Escape closes and restores focus
- Arrow keys + Enter navigate; `role="dialog"` + combobox/listbox + `aria-live` for count
- Manual focus trap (no new dependency unless tests force it)

#### File estimate

~14 files (9 new source, 1 shell mod, 3 unit/integration, 1 E2E). Sequence: types/schema/action stub → queries/service → palette UI → shell mount → tests.

#### Risks / deferred

- Transactions / merchants still deferred
- Statement period match is ISO substring (`2026-07`), not “July 2026”
- Runway has no per-item route — all payment hits land on `/payments/runway`
- SQLite `contains` ASCII case-folding only

#### Test plan

- Unit: schema trim/min/max; service DTO + money fence + href mapping
- Integration: cross-household / cross-user isolation for all three groups
- E2E: ⌘K → type seeded card name → Enter → `/cards/[id]`; Escape restores focus

### Decision

**Pending user approval of Option A.** Do not start Phase 5 until approved.
